# Data Science Portfolio
Showcasing my projects in Data Science

## Introduction
Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my work in AI and data science, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and more. Each project includes a brief description, the tools used, and a link to the full project repository or folder.

## Project 1: Enhancing Histopathology with AI

**Description**: This project leverages CycleGAN and HoverNet architectures to translate IHC stained images to HE stained images and vice versa, as well as to accurately predict cell centroids in histopathological images.

**Tools Used**: Python, PyTorch, CycleGAN, HoverNet, Medical Imaging Datasets, Google Cloud Platform

**Key Features**:
- **CycleGAN Implementation**: Developed a CycleGAN model from scratch to generate synthetic HE images from IHC images and vice versa.
- **HoverNet Implementation**: Employed a HoverNet model to predict cell centroids in translated HE images.
- **Pipeline Creation**: Combined both models into a single pipeline, enabling cell centroid prediction in IHC images without requiring a model trained on IHC data.
- **Medical Imaging Enhancement**: Aimed to reduce costs and time associated with IHC staining by generating reliable synthetic HE images.

## Project 2: Stock Data Webscraping and Analysis

**Description**: Webscraped stock data and used the Ticker API to extract information and visualize stock trends.

**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Ticker API, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Features**:
- Webscraped stock data from websites.
- Extracted and analyzed stock information using the Ticker API.
- Visualized stock trends using plotting techniques.
